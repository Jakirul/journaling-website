# LAP 1 Portfolio Week Project

A project to create an anonymous community journalling website, made for the project week of LAP 1
of the futureproof Conway cohort. We designed a website where users can share and react to jokes.
The website includes a page where users can submit a joke and add a gif from giphy if they want.
There is also a page which displays all the submitted jokes and users can comment on them and react
to them using three emoji reactions. The jokes display page initially only displays the set up for
the jokes, the user has to click a button to reveal the punchline of the joke and view/add comments.

## Installation and Usage

**Installation**

- Clone the repository
- In the server folder run `npm install` to install dependencies

**Usage**

## Technologies

The front end was created using HTML5 and CSS3, with JavaScript to add functionality. This project
makes use of the giphy API to generate the gifs used in the posts.

The back end was created using `node.js` and `express.js` to create the server.
